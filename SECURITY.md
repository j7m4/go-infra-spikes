# Security Policy

## ⚠️ PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PROJECT ⚠️

**This project is a proof-of-concept demonstration and is NOT intended for production use.**

## Security Disclaimers

**DO NOT use this code in production environments.** This project contains:

- **Insecure defaults** (e.g., `tls.insecure = true`)
- **No authentication mechanisms**
- **No network security hardening**
- **No input validation**
- **No rate limiting**
- **Default passwords and configurations**
- **Unencrypted communications**
- **No security monitoring**

## Supported Versions

❌ **No versions are supported for security updates** as this is demonstration code only.

## Reporting Security Issues

Given the proof-of-concept nature of this project, we do not maintain a security response process. However, if you notice security-related educational opportunities or improvements to the demonstration, feel free to open an issue.
